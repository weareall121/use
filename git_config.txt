git config --global user.email "yourmal@gmail.com"

# 1. Initialize Git in this folder
git init

# 2. Rename the branch to 'main' (Best practice)
git branch -M main

# 3. Connect to your specific repository link
git remote add origin https://github.com/NotNahid/django-inventory.git

# 4. Add all files to the "Staging Area"
git add .

# 5. Save the snapshot (Commit)
git commit -m "Initial commit: Django Inventory System with Cart and Descriptions"

# 6. Upload to GitHub (Push)
git push -u origin main



git remote set-url origin https://github.com/NotNahid/django-inventory.git
git push -u origin main


















Since you already created the repository link (`https://github.com/NotNahid/django-inventory`), here is the exact sequence to connect your Cloud Shell code to that link and upload it.

### **Step 1: Tell Git Who You Are (Configuration)**

Run these two commands so GitHub knows it's you.
*(Replace the email with your actual GitHub email)*

```bash
git config --global user.name "NotNahid"
git config --global user.email "YOUR_REAL_EMAIL@gmail.com"

```

### **Step 2: Login to GitHub (Authentication)**

Since you are in Cloud Shell, you need to authorize your terminal to push code.
Run this command and **follow the on-screen instructions** (select GitHub.com -> SSH -> Upload Key -> Login with Browser).

```bash
gh auth login

```

### **Step 3: Connect and Push**

Now, run this block to initialize git, save your files, link them to your repo, and upload.

```bash
# 1. Initialize Git in this folder
git init

# 2. Rename the branch to 'main' (Best practice)
git branch -M main

# 3. Connect to your specific repository link
git remote add origin https://github.com/NotNahid/django-inventory.git

# 4. Add all files to the "Staging Area"
git add .

# 5. Save the snapshot (Commit)
git commit -m "Initial commit: Django Inventory System with Cart and Descriptions"

# 6. Upload to GitHub (Push)
git push -u origin main

```

**Common Error Note:**
If it says `fatal: remote origin already exists`, it means you already linked it earlier. Just run this command to force the new link, then push again:

```bash
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/NotNahid/django-inventory.git
git push -u origin main

```

Let me know if you see the "100%" progress bar!
